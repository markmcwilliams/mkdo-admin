A plugin to tame the WordPress dashbaord. 

Big thanks to Mark Wilkinson http://markwilkinson.me/ for the work he did on this before we refactored it all, and all the work he has done on wpbasis https://github.com/wpmark/wpbasis which served as a big inspiration for this project.

To get up and running, download the plugin and drop it in your plugins folder. You will then need to cd into that folder and run `composer install` to pull down its dependancies.

If you don't know about composer, here is the link you need: https://getcomposer.org/
